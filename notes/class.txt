object oriented programming = organzing our code into object (tries to represent the real world)

now after making object we are moving to class 
Class = object generator
console.log(businessCart instanceof Cart); 
this is check if the businessCart is genrated from the Cart or in other word we can say that is the instance of the class


class Cart{   // create a class keyword
    // move the properties 
    cartItems = undefined;  // modern version // and remove undefined and use semicolon it stay the same
    constructor(){

        this.cartItems = undefined;  // this is the older version by defining the property inside the constructor

    }

    3. Methos : loadFromStorage(){
        this.cartItems = JSON.parse(localStorage,getItem()this.localStoragekey)
    }
    we can use a many as method as we want
    What is the Method ?
    A method is an action that an object or class can perform 


What is localStoragekey ?
localStorage is letting us choose the key used in localStorage dynamically from outside the class

}


Benfits of class : 
1 . A class look like the object that it generate but more cleaner
2. class have extra features like constructor
3. constructor let us put this setup code inside the class

Detail about constructor : 1 . has to named "constructor"
2. should not return anything from constructor
