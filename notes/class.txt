object oriented programming = organzing our code into object (tries to represent the real world)

now after making object we are moving to class 
Class = object generator
console.log(businessCart instanceof Cart); 
this is check if the businessCart is genrated from the Cart or in other word we can say that is the instance of the class


class Cart{   // create a class keyword
    // move the properties 
    cartItems = undefined;  // modern version // and remove undefined and use semicolon it stay the same
    constructor(){

        this.cartItems = undefined;  // this is the older version by defining the property inside the constructor

    }

    3. Methos : loadFromStorage(){
        this.cartItems = JSON.parse(localStorage,getItem()this.localStoragekey)
    }
    we can use a many as method as we want
    What is the Method ?
    A method is an action that an object or class can perform 


What is localStoragekey ?
localStorage is letting us choose the key used in localStorage dynamically from outside the class

}
 we used #localStoragekey everywhere because by that when we working in the team no one can change it mean (private)



Benfits of class : 
1 . A class look like the object that it generate but more cleaner
2. class have extra features like constructor
3. constructor let us put this setup code inside the class
4. A class lets us create private property and method with the use of (#) in front



Convert a object into class
important : .map(()=>{
    is used to loop through an array and though each value it run a function
})

Detail about constructor : 1 . has to named "constructor"
2. should not return anything from constructor  


1 . super
2.method overriding
3. Polymorphism

INHERTAINCE : 
1. what is inhertaince ? ans : inhertiance allows one class which is child to reuse properites and method of another class (parent)
